# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
For this weeks project we analyzed a data set from Kicktarter in order to maximize and optimize the reach for a campaign we might want to start there, following the story of a theater enthusiast that wanted to set up their own play.

### Purpose
The purpose for this analysis was to familiarize ourselves with the tool that is excel and all the great visualization options it brings to the table.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When analyzing the date for theater projects based on the month they were posted on the site we can see a clear difference for projects launched in may in contrast to all other months, on the other hand december projects have almost an equal rate of succesful v failed projects, so best to stay clear from the end of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We see a clear advantage for having smaller goals as opposed to larger ones, staying below $20,000 USD seems to be fine. We also see some advtange for having a goal for the $35,000 to $45000 range but i think that may be more related to a lack of data for those ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I think the biggest challenge i faced while doing this excercise was the fact that my software is in spanish while all the documentation and instructions were in english so trying to translate the instructions while also doing the work might have posed a bigger challenge than intended.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The two main take aways are launch your Kickstarter in may and stay away from december in order to maximize your chances for success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If possible aim for a gaol lower than $20,000 USD, and if you have to go over that aim for the $35,000 to $45,000 range that seems to have a better than average success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Since the individual donations are not tracked, only the results, then analysis of time of donation, time between donations, etc. cannot be tracked so no information can be extracted from that.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Success v duration, donation size v goal, success v country, and many more.
